Austin Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission Maps
=========================================================

The Austin ICRC is putting out draft maps as they work. [While you can "view" them on the site](http://www.austinredistricting.org/maps/interactive-preliminary-map/), it isn't exactly a fun experience. So I intend to free them from their .KMZ jail as they are made available. Any and all ideas are appreciated!
